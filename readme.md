# prtscn
I wanted to learn how to write a port scanner and I followed this nice [article](https://medium.com/@KentGruber/building-a-high-performance-port-scanner-with-golang-9976181ec39d).
Added command line flags.

## usage

### get options
```
./prtscn -h
```

### scan for open ports from 1 to 65535
```
./prtscn | grep open
```
